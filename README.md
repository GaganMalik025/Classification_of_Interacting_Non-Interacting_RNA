# Classification_of_Interacting_Non-Interacting_RNA
Provided with given sequence of protiens, I create a model to predict whether a given proten is Interacting or Not-Interacting

Accuracy I achieve with the testing dataset is of 84.99%.

This was originally a Kaggle competition question hosted by my Proffessor, Dr. G.P.S. Raghava. So, I am not in posession of the test dataset actual values. The accuracy I mentioned before is the accuracy that it showed on the competition webpage.
